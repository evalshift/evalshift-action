"""The docs must not describe flows the product has removed.

`thresholds:` was deleted from `evalshift.yaml` in CLI 1.1.0 -- a config that
still sets it fails to load, by name -- and `policy:configure` was deleted from
the server's permission catalog along with the single write it guarded. This
repo's README, DOCS.md and llms-full.txt described both for five releases after
they were gone, and llms-full.txt is copied verbatim to
https://www.evalshift.dev/ci-llms-full.txt, so the stale instructions were being
served to coding agents as current guidance.

Nothing else noticed, because every existing docs test checks a version literal
rather than a claim. This is the tripwire for claims: a term retired from the
product must not reappear in prose.
