# EvalShift GitHub Action Documentation

The EvalShift GitHub Action turns your golden suite into a **merge gate**. On every pull
request it runs the suite against both models, pushes the result to hosted EvalShift, compares
it to the latest run on your base branch, and fails the check when your migration policy says
the candidate is not safe to ship.

- **Action ref:** `evalshift/evalshift-action@v0` · **version:** 0.6.2 · **License:** MIT
- **Kind:** composite action — installs Python + the pinned EvalShift CLI, then runs a small
  stdlib-only helper script. Nothing is compiled, nothing is containerised.
- **Pinned CLI:** `evalshift==1.2.1` by default, overridable.
- **What it adds on top of the CLI:** hosted push, baseline lookup, cross-branch diff, the
  governed policy verdict, one self-updating PR comment, a commit status, and an exit code.

> **Behaviour change — the default gate moved.** `fail-on` now defaults to `policy`: the exit
> code follows hosted EvalShift's verdict on your project's migration policy, not the action's
> own count of regressions in the diff. The two can disagree in both directions. Set
> `fail-on: regression` to keep the previous behaviour. See
> [Gating: the `fail-on` modes](#gating-the-fail-on-modes).

## Who this is for

You already have an EvalShift golden suite and you run it by hand before shipping a model or
prompt change. That works right up until it doesn't: someone edits a system prompt on a Friday,
nobody re-runs the suite, and the regression ships.

This action closes that gap. It makes "did this change make the model worse?" a required check,
answered by the same statistics you'd get locally, on a pull request, before anyone can merge.

If you don't have a suite yet, start with the CLI — `pip install evalshift && evalshift demo`
gives you a working project in one command. Come back here once `evalshift compare` passes
locally.

---

## Prerequisites

Four things, all required:

| # | Requirement | How to get it |
| - | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1 | `evalshift.yaml` committed to the repo | `evalshift init` (or `evalshift demo` for a scaffolded example) |
| 2 | A golden JSONL suite committed | `evalshift init` writes one; `evalshift capture sync` grows it from production captures |
| 3 | Repository secret `EVALSHIFT_TOKEN` | Hosted EvalShift → Settings → API tokens → Service accounts. A scoped service-account key, starting with `es_`. See [The EvalShift token](#the-evalshift-token). |
| 4 | A model provider API key as a repository secret | Whichever provider your config's models belong to |

Verify locally first. If `evalshift compare --yes` doesn't pass on your machine, it will not
pass on a runner — you'll just pay for the model calls to find out.

---

## Quick start

Create `.github/workflows/evalshift.yml`:

```yaml
name: evalshift

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
  statuses: write

jobs:
  evalshift:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      EVALSHIFT_NONINTERACTIVE: "1"
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: evalshift/evalshift-action@v0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.EVALSHIFT_TOKEN }}
          fail-on: policy # the default; gates on your migration policy
```

Keep the `push: branches: [main]` trigger. The PR comment's diff table needs something to
compare against — the most recent run on your base branch — and it's what the diff-based
`fail-on` modes (`regression`, `any-slice-regression`) gate on. Without trunk runs, every PR
reports "no baseline". Under the default `fail-on: policy` this by itself does **not** pass the
check: the gate is your migration policy evaluated against the run's own source/target
comparison, and it runs whether or not a baseline exists. See
[Gating: the `fail-on` modes](#gating-the-fail-on-modes).

The CLI's `evalshift init --ci` scaffolds a near-identical workflow for you.

### What you'll see on the first PR

The comment says no compatible baseline run was found — expected, since there's no trunk run yet
to diff against; that's a `regression`-mode diff observation, not a misconfiguration. It says
nothing about whether the job passes.

Under the default `fail-on: policy`, this same first PR is gated by the run's own policy
verdict, independent of the baseline: `evalshift init` always writes a `migration_policy` block
into `evalshift.yaml` (every migration profile has one), so a project scaffolded the way these
docs recommend carries a policy from its very first run, and hosted EvalShift evaluates it — the
job passes only if that verdict does. A run is reported as **ungated** only when the config
carries no `migration_policy` at all — see
[When no policy was pushed](#when-no-policy-was-pushed) — which isn't the case here unless you
deleted the block `init` wrote. Merge the first PR, let the `push` trigger record a baseline on
`main`, and the next PR additionally gets a real diff table alongside the policy verdict.

---

## The EvalShift token

### Storing it

`token` must come from a GitHub **encrypted secret** — repository, environment, or
organization. There is no other supported storage.

- **Never commit it.** Not to a config file, not to a `.env` the workflow reads, not as a
  literal `env:` or `with:` value in the workflow YAML. Anyone who can read the repo can read
  those, and deleting the line later does not remove it from git history.
- **Never expose it to `pull_request_target`.** That trigger runs the base repository's
  workflow — with secrets in scope — against a fork's code, so a fork PR can exfiltrate the
  key. Use `pull_request`: it has no secrets on a fork run, and the action fails cleanly on the
  empty `token`.
- **Prefer an environment secret in production repositories.** Scoping the key to a deployment
  environment lets you attach required reviewers and branch restrictions to the credential
  itself, rather than trusting every workflow in the repo with it.

```yaml
jobs:
  evalshift:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ci          # the environment that holds EVALSHIFT_TOKEN
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: evalshift/evalshift-action@v0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.EVALSHIFT_TOKEN }}
```

Masking is not storage. The action registers the token with GitHub's log masking and redacts it
out of CLI output, but that only protects the job's own logs.

### Least privilege: a service-account key, not a personal token

Mint the token from a **service account** — EvalShift web app → Settings → API tokens →
Service accounts, at `/app/<org-slug>/settings/tokens`. A service account is an org-owned
machine identity, so the credential survives the person who set CI up leaving the team. A
personal token is tied to one membership; when that membership goes, every pipeline using it
goes red. Do not use a personal token for CI.

The scope picker on that page speaks EvalShift's permission keys directly. The action needs
exactly three:

| Scope | What needs it |
| ----- | ------------- |
| `run:create` | `evalshift push` — creating the hosted run and finalizing the upload — and the [plan preflight](#plan-limits-and-the-ci-preflight), `POST /runs/preflight`. |
| `run:read` | `GET /runs/{id}/baseline-compatible` and the diff the PR comment shows (and the diff-based `fail-on` modes gate on). |
| `policy:read` | `GET /runs/{id}/policy-check`, the verdict the default `fail-on: policy` gates on. |

Give the service account the `member` role; it holds all three. A `viewer` holds `run:read`
and `policy:read` but not `run:create`, so it can look but never upload.

One consequence of a correctly-scoped key, by design:

- **It cannot auto-create the hosted project.** `project:create` is an owner permission, and a
  service account is never an owner. Create the project once in the web app, then set
  `create-project: false` so a wrong project slug reads as a missing project rather than as a
  credential problem.

The `migration_policy` block rides inside the run bundle `run:create` already uploads; reading
the verdict back is what needs `policy:read`. Leave it off and the push still succeeds, but the
default gate cannot read its verdict: it falls back to `fail-on: regression` for that run, with
a warning naming the missing permission. It does not fail the job, so the gap is easy to miss.

A denial is self-diagnosing: the action prints the exact permission key the hosted API refused,
plus how to mint a key that holds it — as the job's error for `run:create` and `run:read`, and
in the fallback warning for `policy:read`, which degrades the gate rather than failing the job.

### Rotating it

1. **Rotate** the key in the web app. The old one keeps working for a 24-hour grace window.
2. **Update** the GitHub secret with the new value.
3. **Confirm** a green run on the new key, then let the old one expire.

In that order there is never a moment when the pipeline holds no valid key. Never swap a key's
secret in place — overlapping keys exist precisely so a running deploy cannot race a credential
change. Keys that stop being used are flagged as stale in the web app; a key you rotated away
from should show up dead there within the grace window.

---

## Secrets and provider keys

The action does **not** manage provider credentials. It passes the job environment through to
the CLI, adding `EVALSHIFT_HOST`, `EVALSHIFT_TOKEN` and `COLUMNS=512` (the last so rich does
not fold the hosted run URL across two lines) and touching nothing else, so set the key as a
job-level `env:` entry and the CLI picks it up.

| Provider  | Environment variable                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                  |
| OpenAI    | `OPENAI_API_KEY`                     |
| Google    | `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| DeepSeek  | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`                   |

Which key you need follows from `defaults.source_model` and `defaults.target_model` in your
`evalshift.yaml`. Comparing across two providers means both keys:

```yaml
    env:
      EVALSHIFT_NONINTERACTIVE: "1"
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

`EVALSHIFT_NONINTERACTIVE: "1"` is recommended. The action already passes `--yes`, which skips
the CLI's cost confirmation, but the env var covers any other prompt — and a prompt on a runner
means a hung job.

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | What it does |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ------------ |
| `token` | yes | — | Hosted EvalShift API token, an `es_...` value. Masked in logs and redacted from CLI output. |
| `host` | no | `https://api.evalshift.dev` | Hosted API base URL. Set only for a self-hosted or staging deployment. |
| `config` | no | `evalshift.yaml` | Path to your config, relative to the repository root. Paths *inside* the config (prompt files, tools) resolve relative to the config file's own directory, so a config in a subdirectory works. |
| `suite` | no | `golden.jsonl` | Path to the golden JSONL suite, relative to the repository root. Selects a *file* and nothing else — see [Selecting a suite](#selecting-a-suite-name-vs-path). Mutually exclusive with `suite-name`. |
| `suite-name` | no | — | Name of a suite wired under `suites:` in `evalshift.yaml`. Prefer this over `suite`. Needs `evalshift-version` >= `0.14.0`. See [Selecting a suite](#selecting-a-suite-name-vs-path). |
| `evalshift-version` | no | `1.2.1` | Exact CLI version installed from PyPI. Pin this for run-to-run reproducibility across CLI releases. |
| `python-version` | no | `3.12` | Python used to install and run the CLI. Must satisfy the CLI's minimum (3.11 for 1.2.1). |
| `fail-on` | no | `policy` | Gating mode. See [below](#gating-the-fail-on-modes). |
| `require-policy` | no | `false` | Whether a run pushed without a `migration_policy` fails the job. By default such a run merges, reported as ungated — a `::warning::` annotation and a commit status saying the gate is off. Read only under `fail-on: policy`. See [When no policy was pushed](#when-no-policy-was-pushed). |
| `branch` | no | auto | Candidate branch name recorded on the hosted run. Auto-detected from the PR head ref, else the pushed ref. |
| `base-branch` | no | auto | Branch to look for a baseline run on. Auto-detected from the PR base ref, else the current ref. Resolving to empty means no baseline is fetched. That only passes the check under `fail-on: regression` / `any-slice-regression`; the default `fail-on: policy` still gates on the run's own policy check. |
| `create-project` | no | `true` | Whether `evalshift push` may auto-create the hosted project when it doesn't exist. Set `false` to make a missing project a hard failure. |
| `comment` | no | `true` | Whether to create or update the PR comment. Set `false` to keep the commit status but stay out of the conversation. |
| `github-token` | no | `github.token` | Token used for the PR comment and the commit status. Override only to have a bot account post instead of `github-actions`. |
| `repo-private` | no | `${{ github.event.repository.private }}` | Whether this repository is private, used by the [plan preflight](#plan-limits-and-the-ci-preflight). Reported to EvalShift, not verified by it. Override only when the GitHub context doesn't describe the code you're actually evaluating. |

Boolean inputs accept `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` (case-insensitive). Anything else is false.

---

## Outputs

| Output | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| `run_url` | Hosted run URL for this run. |
| `diff_url` | Hosted diff URL comparing this run to the baseline. Empty string when no compatible baseline was found. |
| `run_id` | Hosted EvalShift run id — the server-minted id every `/runs/{id}` API route takes. Not the local `r_…` run directory name. |
| `regression_count` | Number of regressed examples in the hosted diff. `0` when there is no baseline. |
| `conclusion` | `success` or `failure`, reflecting `fail-on`. These are GitHub commit-status states, so a policy that *declined* to decide is `success` here — the PR comment and the status description carry the verdict itself. |

Consume them from a later step:

```yaml
      - uses: evalshift/evalshift-action@v0
        id: evalshift
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.EVALSHIFT_TOKEN }}
      - run: echo "Hosted diff ${{ steps.evalshift.outputs.diff_url }}"
```

Outputs are written before the comment and status calls, so they're still available even if the
job lacks permission to comment.

## Gating: the `fail-on` modes

| Mode | The job fails when |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| `policy` | Hosted EvalShift evaluates the run against the migration policy it was pushed with — the `migration_policy` block of your `evalshift.yaml` — and answers `fail`. **Default.** |
| `never` | Never. Records the run, pushes it, comments — but never blocks the merge. Use while you're still calibrating a suite. |
| `regression` | The hosted diff reports one or more regressed examples in aggregate. |
| `any-slice-regression` | Any slice's pass rate moved down, even when the aggregate is flat or improved. Stricter — catches one slice degrading while the overall number hides it. |

### `policy` — the governed gate

`policy` is the only mode that enforces what you configured. What you configured is the
`migration_policy` block of your `evalshift.yaml`: the CLI resolves it, `evalshift push` carries
it along with the run, and the server gates that run on that snapshot forever — a later edit to
the yaml never rewrites a past verdict. The action calls `GET /runs/{run-id}/policy-check` and
follows the answer; it does not re-implement a single threshold. The same verdict is what your
local `evalshift compare` and the run's Policy tab show, so a merge blocked in CI is blocked for
the same stated reason everywhere.

That makes it disagree with `regression` in both directions, on purpose:

- A run with regressed examples that still sits inside every budget **passes**. Under
  `regression` it would have failed, and the honest reading is that your policy said this much
  movement is acceptable.
- A run whose aggregate regression count is `0` but which busts a cost, latency or per-slice
  budget **fails**. `regression` never saw that question.

The response also carries the arithmetic — each budget's observed value, its allowance, its
scope, and whether the measurement was conclusive — and every blocking regression behind the
verdict. Both are rendered into the PR comment, so the check explains itself without a trip to
the web app.

#### The four statuses

`policy-check` answers with a closed set of four. Exactly one of them fails the job.

| `status` | `should_fail` | Rendered as |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `pass` | `False` | A clean pass. No caveat blockquote. |
| `conditional_pass` | `False` | A pass, with a caveat blockquote and the server's reason. |
| `fail` | `True` | A failure, with the busted budgets and blocking regressions. |
| `inconclusive` | `False` | Undecided — explicitly *not* a pass. |
| `inconclusive`, `policy_source: none` | `False`, or `True` under `require-policy` | Ungated — no policy was pushed with the run. Its own wording, its own annotation. |

**`conditional_pass` is a pass.** Every budget held and nothing critical or high regressed, but
something milder did: medium/low regressions, and/or comparisons that scored zero pairs. The
server says so in its own reason — which contains *"not a gate failure"* and ends *"Review
before merging."* — and the action passes that through verbatim. It does not fail the gate, and
it is not treated as undecided: the check is green, with a blockquote saying the run is not
clean and pointing at the reason.

**`inconclusive` has six distinct causes**, carried only by the `reason` string:

1. the run carried no policy — there were no budgets to check, and `policy` is `null` with
   `budgets: []`. The server reports `policy_source: "none"` for this one, and the action
   handles it separately; see [When no policy was pushed](#when-no-policy-was-pushed);
2. no policy metrics were recorded for the run at all;
3. nothing was measured — no blocking evaluator scored a single record, so the quality
   budgets are clean by absence rather than by evidence;
4. nothing was comparable — every comparison scored severity `insufficient`;
5. a budget was breached, but on too small a sample to confirm the breach;
6. a slice your policy declares was not measured by this run.

The action never substitutes its own wording for these. It prints the server's `reason`
verbatim in the PR comment, because paraphrasing would collapse six different problems — and
six different fixes — into one sentence on the surface you actually read. It is also why the
list growing (it went from three to six when the gate stopped inventing a default policy)
changes nothing the action has to ship: it never enumerated them in code.

**When the policy declines to answer.** `inconclusive` — and any status outside the four above,
which a newer server may return to an older pinned action — **does not fail the job**, and is
never presented as a pass. The comment and the commit-status description say the gate did not
decide. The `conclusion` output stays `success`, because it is a GitHub commit-status state and
there is no third value; read the comment, not the output, when you care about the difference.

#### When no policy was pushed

`policy_source: "none"` with `inconclusive` is the one case that is not a judgement about your
run: the run reached the server carrying no `migration_policy`, so there was no gate to run.
Every check is green, and nothing about a green check says the gate is off — which is why the
action treats this case on its own:

- the job log, the commit-status description and the PR comment say *"the gate is off — no
  migration policy was pushed with this run; add migration_policy to evalshift.yaml"*, instead
  of the `inconclusive` wording about a policy that could not decide;
- a `::warning::` workflow annotation is printed on **stdout**, so it surfaces in the job
  summary and on the PR's Files view. (GitHub collects annotations from stdout only; the
  fallback warning below goes to stderr, where it is log text and nothing more.)

The fix is one block in `evalshift.yaml` and a push. Until then the job still merges —
upgrading the action must not turn a repository red overnight. Set `require-policy: true` when
you want an ungated PR to be a failing check instead; it governs this case only, never a verdict
the policy did reach and never the unavailable-check fallback below.

**When the policy check is unavailable.** If it errors, is refused (a key without
`policy:read`), 404s, or has no stored decision for the run, the action falls back to
`regression` gating for that run and announces it in the job log, the commit-status
description, and the PR comment. It does not silently go green — but for that
run the gate is the diff, not your policy.

### The diff-only modes

`any-slice-regression` is not simply "stricter than `regression`" in every case; it's a
different question. A run where the aggregate regression count is above zero but no individual
slice moved down will fail under `regression` and pass under `any-slice-regression`. If you
want both guarantees, run the action twice with different modes (and `comment: "false"` on one
of them), or keep `regression` and rely on slices for diagnosis rather than gating.

**Suggested progression:** start at `never` for a week or two while the suite settles, then move
to `policy` and tune the budgets in `evalshift.yaml` until the gate agrees with your own judgement of
which PRs should have been blocked. Reach for `regression` or `any-slice-regression` only when
you deliberately want a diff-shaped question the policy doesn't ask.

When no compatible baseline run exists on the base branch, there's nothing to compare against:
the diff-based modes pass, `regression_count` is `0`, and the PR comment says so explicitly.
`policy` still asks the server for a verdict — the policy is about this run, not about the
comparison.

---

## What lands on the pull request

### One comment, updated in place

The action maintains exactly one comment per PR, marked with a hidden HTML marker so it edits
itself on every push instead of stacking up. With a baseline present it looks like this:

> ## EvalShift regression check
>
> **Conclusion:** `failure`
> **Hosted run:** [open run](https://app.evalshift.dev/…)
> **Regressions:** 3
> **Diff:** [compare to baseline](https://app.evalshift.dev/…)
> **Policy decision:** `fail` (from `project_policy`)
> **Why:** pass-rate drop of 4.2 pts exceeds the allowed 2.0 pts
>
> ### Policy budgets
>
> | Budget | Scope | Observed | Allowed | Result |
> | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
> | pass_rate_drop | overall | 0.042 | 0.02 | fail |
> | cost_increase | overall | 0.1 | 0.25 | pass (not confident) |
>
> ### Blocking regressions
>
> | Prompt | Evaluator | Slice | Severity | Score delta |
> | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
> | p-refund | accuracy | safety_refusals | critical | -0.4 |
>
> **Pass-rate movement:** -12 pts
>
> | Slice | Pass-rate delta |
> | --- | ---: |
> | safety_refusals | -25 pts |
> | tool_selection | -8 pts |

The two policy sections appear under `fail-on: policy` only; the other modes never ask for a
verdict, so there is nothing honest to render.

Budgets are listed failing-first and capped at 12 rows, blocking regressions at 10, with a
line naming how many were omitted — a policy with a per-slice budget for fifty slices should not
bury the diff under its own table. Each row names the `scope` it was judged at: `overall`, or
the slice name for a per-slice budget, so one budget name evaluated across ten slices still
reads unambiguously. When the cap hides failing budgets, the omission line says how many
(*"8 more budgets not shown, 8 of them failing"*) — with per-slice budgets there can be more
failures than fit, and a bare count would read as "the rest were fine". `pass (not confident)`
marks a budget the server reported as `conclusive: false`: the measurement was too noisy to
tell, and rendering it as a clean pass would be a lie of omission.

A run where nothing was comparable comes back with `budgets: []` and `status: "inconclusive"`.
Both tables are then omitted entirely rather than rendered empty, and the server's reason is
what the reader gets instead.

A blockquote above the tables states the caveat on a `conditional_pass`, and states plainly
when the policy could not decide or when the policy check could not be reached.

Up to five regressed slices are listed, worst first. When nothing regressed you get a single
`No regressed slices` row. Percentages are rounded for display only — gating uses the raw
values, so a slice can appear as `0 pts` and still count as a regression.

Without a baseline, the slice table is replaced by a single line: *No compatible baseline run
was found on the base branch.* The policy sections still render.

### A commit status

Context `evalshift/regression`, linking to the hosted diff (or the run, when there's no diff).
For a single-suite workflow, this is what you add to branch protection to make EvalShift a
required check. It's set on push events too, not just pull requests. If your workflow runs
several suites in a matrix (as `evalshift init --ci` scaffolds), every suite's job sets this same
context, so require the scaffold's `evalshift gate` join job instead — see
[Make it a required check](#make-it-a-required-check).

---

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
| ---------- | --- |
| `contents: read` | Checking out the repository. |
| `pull-requests: write` | Posting the PR comment. |
| `issues: write` | PR comments are issue comments in the GitHub API. |
| `statuses: write` | Setting the `evalshift/regression` commit status. |

Only `contents: read` is strictly required. If the comment or status permissions are missing,
the action logs a warning and carries on rather than failing the run — the gate still works.

---

## How it works, step by step

1. **Install.** `actions/setup-python` at `python-version`, then `pip install
   evalshift==<evalshift-version>`. No pip caching, so budget roughly 20–60 seconds.
2. **Preflight.** Asks hosted EvalShift whether this job is covered by the org's plan, before
   a single model call. A `402` stops the job here, and so do the answers the push would repeat
   after the suite had been paid for: a rejected token (`401`), a key without `run:create`
   (`403`), and a missing project under `create-project: false` (`404`). Anything else lets it
   continue. See [Plan limits and the CI preflight](#plan-limits-and-the-ci-preflight).
3. **Run.** `evalshift all --yes --config <config>` plus the suite selection
   (`--suite-name <name>`, or `--suite <path>`) in the workspace root.
   This is the full local pipeline: doctor → run → evaluate → analyze → report. Artifacts land
   in `.evalshift/runs/<run-id>/`, including the self-contained `report.html`. The CLI has since
   renamed this command to `evalshift compare` and kept `all` as a permanent alias, so the action
   types `all` — the one spelling every installable CLI version answers to, including releases
   older than the rename. Type `evalshift compare` when you run it yourself.
4. **Push.** `evalshift push <run-id>` uploads the run bundle to hosted EvalShift, creating the
   project if `create-project` allows it. Git metadata from the runner environment travels with
   the bundle so the server can pair this run with base-branch runs later.
5. **Find a baseline.** Asks the hosted API for the latest compatible run on the base branch.
   "Compatible" is a server-side judgement — a suite that changed shape can't be diffed against
   an older one.
6. **Fetch the diff.** Pulls aggregate and per-slice deltas from the hosted API.
7. **Ask the policy gate.** Under `fail-on: policy`, `GET /runs/{id}/policy-check` returns the
   server's verdict on this run against the migration policy it was pushed with, plus the
   budget-by-budget arithmetic behind it. Skipped in the other modes.
8. **Report.** Writes the five outputs, upserts the PR comment, sets the commit status.
9. **Gate.** Exits non-zero when the gate says so — the policy verdict under `fail-on: policy`,
   the diff otherwise.

The action is a wrapper, not a reimplementation. All evaluation and statistics happen in the
CLI; all cross-branch diffing happens server-side. If you want to understand what
`regression_count` actually means, read the CLI's statistical methodology docs — it's paired
statistics with Benjamini-Hochberg correction, not a threshold on an average.

### One thing that surprises people

Output is captured per command and printed when that command finishes, not streamed live. A
suite that takes six minutes looks like a hung job for six minutes. It isn't.

---

## Branch and baseline resolution

The action figures out two branch names, and both matter:

- **`branch`** — the candidate, recorded on the hosted run. From the PR head ref, else the
  pushed ref.
- **`base-branch`** — where to look for a baseline. From the PR base ref, else the current ref.

On a `push` event, `base-branch` falls back to the branch being pushed. A push to `main`
therefore diffs against the *previous* `main` run. That's intentional: it tracks trunk drift
over time, and it's how baselines get recorded in the first place.

Override `branch` / `base-branch` only when your branch naming genuinely differs from your git
refs — for example if you push through a mirror that rewrites ref names. If `base-branch`
resolves to an empty string, the action skips the baseline lookup entirely. That makes the
diff-based `fail-on` modes (`regression`, `any-slice-regression`) pass, since there is nothing to
compare against; it does not affect the default `fail-on: policy`, which asks the server for a
policy verdict regardless of baseline.

---

## Cost control

Every run makes real model calls against both the source and target model. Suite size × 2 is
your per-run cost, and the runner starts with a cold cache every time, so nothing is free on
repeat runs the way it is locally.

Practical levers, in order of effect:

**Only run when it matters.** Most PRs don't touch prompts or the suite:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "eval/**"
      - "app/prompts/**"
      - "evalshift.yaml"
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

**Keep the CI suite smaller than your full local suite.** A 40-example CI suite that runs on
every PR catches more regressions in practice than a 500-example suite you disable after the
first invoice.

**Use cheap evaluators in CI.** Structural evaluators cost nothing. LLM-judge evaluators are a
third model call per example. If your local config leans on judges, consider a CI-specific
config pointed at with `config:`.

**Don't gate on draft PRs:**

```yaml
    if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false
```

---

## Plan limits and the CI preflight

Hosted EvalShift plans limit a few things that CI runs into: runs per month and how many runs
an org may have in flight at once. (Private-repo CI is included on every plan; the preflight
still reports the repository's visibility.) Discovering one of those halfway through a
suite means paying for the model calls and getting nothing, so the action asks first.

An organization whose 30-day trial ended without a subscription is read-only: the preflight
answers `402` with `feature: subscription`, and the job fails before the suite spends anything.
Its runs stay readable in the web app.

**What it does, before running your suite or spending a credit:**

1. Reads `project: <org>/<project>` from your config file — the same key `evalshift push` uses.
2. Makes one call, `POST /runs/preflight`, with
   `{"project_slug": "<org>/<project>", "repo_private": <bool>, "parallelism": 1}`.

That call is addressed by the same slug the upload uses and needs only `run:create`, the
permission the upload needs anyway — so a key that can push can always ask, including a key
pinned to that one project.

**What the server checks** is every limit that would still refuse the upload once the suite has
run: the org is on an active trial or a paid-up subscription, the org is within its seats, the
monthly run quota has a run left, the plan covers CI on a repository of this visibility, and one
job fits under the parallelism cap. How many runs are in flight right now is not checked here —
that changes by the second — and is enforced when the run is uploaded.

**A 402 fails the job immediately.** You get, in three places:

- an `::error::` annotation at the top of the job,
- a step summary block naming the plan, what was blocked, any limit and its reset date, and an
  upgrade link,
- on a pull request, the usual EvalShift comment (same marker, so it replaces the previous one)
  carrying the same message.

Every word of it comes from the server. The action never decides what a plan covers — it can't,
and a client that guesses at entitlements is a client that tells people the wrong thing after
the next pricing change.

**Answers the push would repeat stop the job too**, reported like a `402`: an `::error::`
annotation carrying the fix, a step summary, and the same `conclusion: failure` outputs:

| Answer | Why the job stops |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| `401` | The server doesn't accept the token: mistyped, revoked, past its rotation grace window, or minted for a different `host`. |
| `403` | The key lacks `run:create`. The error names the permission and how to mint a key that holds it. |
| `404` with `create-project: false` | No project with that slug that this key can reach — it doesn't exist, the slug is wrong, or the key is pinned to a different project — and the push is not allowed to create one. |

**A missing project with `create-project: true` is a notice, not a stop.** The first push
creates the project, so the action prints a `::notice::` saying so and runs. The server gates
that upload like any other.

**Everything else is fail-open.** A 5xx, a `422`, a timeout, a DNS failure, a malformed
response — all of them print `warning: plan preflight skipped: ...` and the run continues. So
does a `405` from a hosted server that predates `POST /runs/preflight`; that warning says so.
Billing fails closed; infrastructure fails open. An EvalShift outage must not break your CI,
and the server still enforces every limit when the run is uploaded, so nothing escapes by
skipping the preflight.

**The preflight is skipped entirely** when the config has no top-level `project:` key — there's
no slug to ask about before the CLI builds the bundle.

### About `repo-private`

It defaults to `${{ github.event.repository.private }}` and is *asserted*, not verified: the
server has no view of your GitHub repository. Two consequences worth knowing:

- The server records the first `true` permanently. A project that has ever reported private
  stays private, so reporting `false` afterwards changes nothing.
- Overriding it to `false` on a private repository is a licence violation, not a clever trick.
  If your workflow genuinely evaluates public code from a private repository, set it explicitly
  and be prepared to explain it.

## Selecting a suite: name vs. path

Two inputs select the suite, and they are **not** interchangeable. Set one or the other; the
action fails fast if both are set.

`suite-name` names a key under `suites:` in `evalshift.yaml` — the block `evalshift capture
sync` writes and rewrites:

```yaml
suites:
  planner:
    source: captured
    path: .evalshift/suites/planner/golden.jsonl
    evaluators:
      tool_selection:
        - name: routing
          conformance: expected
          divergence: set
```

```yaml
      - uses: evalshift/evalshift-action@v0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.EVALSHIFT_TOKEN }}
          suite-name: planner
```

`suite` names a file on disk, and nothing more:

```yaml
          suite: .evalshift/suites/planner/golden.jsonl
```

Both load the same rows. Only the name carries that suite's **own evaluator block**. Select
the suite above by path and it is scored with the top-level `evaluators:` instead — for a
tool-calling suite whose top-level evaluators are `semantic` + `llm_judge`, that scores
nothing at all, and the run fails at `analyze` with `scores.jsonl is empty`. Nothing warns
you: a path is a legitimate way to run a suite that has no entry under `suites:`.

So: **if the suite has an entry under `suites:`, select it by name.** Reach for `suite` only
for a one-off file that is not wired into the config. `suite-name` needs an EvalShift CLI of
`0.14.0` or newer; on an older pin the action says so rather than letting the CLI print a
usage error.

## Recipes

### Config in a subdirectory

```yaml
      - uses: evalshift/evalshift-action@v0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.EVALSHIFT_TOKEN }}
          config: eval/evalshift.yaml
          suite: eval/golden.jsonl   # or suite-name: <key>, if it is wired under suites:
```

Paths inside the config resolve relative to the config file, so `prompts.py` next to
`eval/evalshift.yaml` needs no path changes.

### Report-only while calibrating

```yaml
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.EVALSHIFT_TOKEN }}
          fail-on: never
```

### Two suites in one repository

Give each suite its own job, and let only **one** of them own the PR comment:

```yaml
jobs:
  eval-text:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: evalshift/evalshift-action@v0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.EVALSHIFT_TOKEN }}
          suite: eval/golden-text.jsonl

  eval-agent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: evalshift/evalshift-action@v0
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.EVALSHIFT_TOKEN }}
          config: eval/agent.yaml
          suite: eval/golden-agent.jsonl
          comment: "false"
```

The comment marker and the commit status context are both constants, so two commenting
invocations on the same PR overwrite each other's output. One owner, always.

### Keep the HTML report as a build artifact

The action doesn't upload artifacts. Add a step if you want the report retained on the run:

```yaml
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: evalshift-report
          path: .evalshift/runs/**/report.html
```

### Make it a required check

Do this only after the suite has been running at `fail-on: never` long enough that you trust it.

**Single-suite setup** (one `evalshift-action` step per job): branch protection → require status
checks → add `evalshift/regression`, the commit status this action sets.

**Multi-suite setup** (the matrix `evalshift init --ci` scaffolds, one `evalshift-action`
invocation per suite): do **not** require `evalshift/regression` — every suite's job writes that
same commit-status context, so the last suite to finish silently overwrites the others' results,
and requiring it only ever reflects whichever suite finished last. Require the scaffold's join
job instead, named `evalshift gate`; it depends on every suite job and fails if any of them
failed. See the scaffolded workflow's own setup checklist for the same guidance.

### Post as a bot account

```yaml
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.EVALSHIFT_TOKEN }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.MY_BOT_PAT }}
```

Note the comment upsert only edits comments authored by a **Bot** account. A PAT belonging to a
human user will create a new comment on every run instead of updating one.

---

## Security model

- **Secrets are masked and redacted.** The hosted token and GitHub token are registered with
  GitHub's log masking before anything else runs. On top of that, the action redacts any
  environment value whose name contains `TOKEN` or `SECRET`, or ends in `API_KEY`, out of the
  CLI's stdout and stderr before printing it — so a CLI that echoes a key in an error message
  doesn't leak it into your logs.
- **Tokens never appear in argv.** The hosted token and host URL reach the CLI through the
  environment only, so they can't show up in a process listing or a `command failed:` message.
- **Provider keys never leave the job.** The action passes them to the CLI and nowhere else.
  They are not uploaded to hosted EvalShift, not written to the bundle, not sent to GitHub.
- **The action never writes to your repository.** No commits, no pushes, no file mutations
  outside `.evalshift/` in the workspace.
- **Fork PRs.** Secrets aren't available to workflows triggered by `pull_request` from a fork,
  so the action will fail on `token` being empty. That's GitHub's design, and working around it
  with `pull_request_target` means running untrusted code with your secrets in scope — don't,
  unless you fully understand the exposure.
- **The hosted key is a scoped machine credential.** Mint it from a service account with only
  `run:create`, `run:read` and `policy:read`, store it as an encrypted secret, and rotate it
  through the overlapping-key flow. Details and rationale:
  [The EvalShift token](#the-evalshift-token).
- **Dependencies.** The runtime helper is stdlib-only. `pip-audit` runs in this repo's own CI.

---

## Limits and known edges

Worth knowing before you rely on this in anger:

- **The PR comment lookup reads only the first page of comments.** On a very long PR thread the
  EvalShift comment can fall off page one, and a second comment gets created instead of the
  first being updated.
- **The comment marker and status context are global constants.** Parallel invocations on the
  same PR overwrite each other. One commenting invocation per PR.
- **The run that gets pushed is the newest directory under `.evalshift/runs`.** If a step
  between the run and the push touches an older run directory's mtime, the wrong run gets
  pushed. In a normal workflow this never happens.
- **The hosted run URL is parsed from CLI stdout, and the hosted run id is read out of its
  `/app/{org}/{project}/runs/<uuid>` path.** The action anchors that whole shape, so a change
  to either how the push result is printed or how the web app routes runs would break it. The
  repo's `cli-contract` CI job guards flag renames but not output shape; a URL the action
  cannot read a run id out of fails the step rather than gating on a guess.
- **No retries on hosted API calls.** A 30-second timeout, one attempt. A transient hosted
  outage fails the step rather than silently passing — deliberate, but it means a flaky network
  reads as a failed job.
- **`fail-on` decides the exit code, not whether the run happened.** Even at `never`, the run
  executes, costs money, and pushes.
- **A policy that cannot decide does not fail the job.** `inconclusive` — and any status
  outside the four the server defines, which a newer server could return to an older pinned
  action — is reported loudly and gated as a non-failure. If you want undecided to block a
  merge, that is a policy change on the server, not an action input. The single exception is a
  run that carried no policy at all, which `require-policy: true` turns into a failure.
- **`conditional_pass` merges.** It is a pass by design, not a near-miss the action rounds
  down. The check goes green, the comment carries the caveat, and nothing stops the merge. If
  medium/low regressions should block, tighten the policy server-side — the action will not
  second-guess the verdict it was given.
- **An unreachable policy check degrades to `regression`.** The action says so in three places
  rather than going quietly green, but for that run the gate is the diff, not your policy.
- **The plan preflight reads `project:` with a regex, not a YAML parser.** The runtime helper
  has no dependencies. A top-level `project: org/name` is found; anything more exotic isn't,
  and the preflight is skipped rather than guessed at. The server still enforces the limit at
  upload time.
- **A denied preflight fails the job at `fail-on: never` too.** `fail-on` governs regressions;
  a plan that doesn't cover the run is a different question, and the run never happens. The
  same goes for a preflight stopped by a `401`, a `403`, or a `404` under
  `create-project: false`.

## Troubleshooting

### `input 'token' is required`

The `token:` input is empty. Either the secret isn't set, or this is a fork PR where secrets
aren't exposed.

### `command failed (1): evalshift all --yes ...`

The CLI itself failed — bad config, missing provider key, model API error. The CLI's own
(redacted) stderr is printed directly above this line. Reproduce with the same command locally;
`evalshift compare` is that command under its current name, and `all` is its permanent alias.

### `no local EvalShift runs found in .../.evalshift/runs`

`evalshift all` exited successfully but wrote nothing where the action looks. Usually a config
that redirects run artifacts elsewhere, or a working-directory mismatch.

### `evalshift push did not print a hosted run URL`

The push didn't emit a URL on its last output line. Run `evalshift push <run-id>` locally
against the same host and see what it prints. Also check for a CLI version mismatch.

### `could not read a server run id out of the hosted run URL: ...`

The push printed a URL, but the action could not find an `/app/{org}/{project}/runs/<uuid>`
path in it. Every hosted call afterwards is keyed on that id, so the action stops rather than
gate on a guess. Usually a CLI version mismatch — an older CLI printed the local `r_…` run
directory name in the URL instead of the server-minted id. Check the printed URL in the step
log and pin a newer `evalshift-version`.

### HTTP 401 from the hosted API

Bad, revoked, or expired `EVALSHIFT_TOKEN`, or the wrong `host`. Verify with `evalshift whoami`
locally using the same token. A key past its rotation grace window authenticates as nobody.
The [preflight](#plan-limits-and-the-ci-preflight) asks with the same token before the suite
runs, so this usually shows up there, as `hosted EvalShift at <host> rejected the token (HTTP
401)`, before any model credits are spent.

### `The EvalShift token is missing the '<key>' permission`

The key authenticated fine but its scopes (or its service account's role) don't cover what the
step needed. Widen the scope on the existing key, or mint one that holds it — see
[Least privilege](#least-privilege-a-service-account-key-not-a-personal-token). The three the
action needs are `run:create`, `run:read` and `policy:read`. A missing `run:create` stops the
job at the preflight, before the suite runs (when the config names its `project:`). A missing
`policy:read` does not stop anything: it surfaces as the `falling back to fail-on: regression`
warning below.

### `cannot auto-create project: this token must have owner access to the org`

A service-account key cannot create projects; `project:create` is owner-only. Create the project
in the web app and set `create-project: false`.

### `warning: could not upsert PR comment: HTTP 403`

Missing `pull-requests: write` / `issues: write`, or a fork PR with a read-only token. The
gating still works — only the comment is lost.

### The job failed before running anything, with a plan message

The [CI preflight](#plan-limits-and-the-ci-preflight) got a `402`: the org's plan doesn't cover
this run. The annotation and the step summary name the limit and link to the billing page. The
usual cause is the monthly run quota; the org's 30-day trial having ended without a
subscription, an unpaid subscription, or more members than the plan's seats are the others.
Nothing was run and nothing was charged.

### `hosted EvalShift has no project '<org>/<project>' this token can reach (HTTP 404)`

The preflight found no project with the slug in your config's `project:` key, and
`create-project: false` forbids the push to create one, so the job stopped before the suite.
Either the slug is wrong, the project hasn't been created in the web app yet, or the key is
pinned to a different project. With `create-project: true` the same answer is a `::notice::`
and the run continues, because the first push creates the project.

### `warning: plan preflight skipped: ...`

The preflight couldn't get an answer, so the run continued — the intended behavior. Common
causes: hosted EvalShift is unreachable (timeout, DNS failure, 5xx), or it answered with
something the preflight doesn't act on. If the warning says the server `predates POST
/runs/preflight`, the hosted server is older than this action; nothing is wrong on your side.
The server still enforces plan limits when the run is uploaded, so this warning never means a
limit was bypassed.

### `warning: hosted policy check ...; falling back to fail-on: regression`

Under `fail-on: policy` the action could not get a verdict for this run — the endpoint errored,
refused the key (`HTTP 403` naming `policy:read`: add that scope to the key), answered `404`, or
holds no stored decision for the run. The job still gated, but on the diff rather than on your
policy, and the PR comment carries the same warning. This is about reading the verdict, not
about having a policy: a run pushed without one gets an answer, and that answer is the
annotation below.

### `::warning::no migration policy was pushed with this run`

Your `evalshift.yaml` has no `migration_policy` block, so nothing gated this PR — the check is
green because no gate ran, not because the run was clean. Add the block and push again; the
policy travels with every run from then on. See
[When no policy was pushed](#when-no-policy-was-pushed), and `require-policy: true` if you would
rather the job failed until then.

### The check is always green

In order of likelihood: nothing is gating at all because the run carried no `migration_policy`
(the job log carries a `::warning::` saying so — see
[When no policy was pushed](#when-no-policy-was-pushed)); under the default `fail-on: policy`,
the policy is permissive enough that nothing has busted a budget yet (the comment shows the
budget arithmetic — if every row passes with room to spare, tighten it in `evalshift.yaml`);
`fail-on` is `never`; or you're on `fail-on: regression` / `any-slice-regression` and either no
baseline run exists on the base branch yet (add the `push` trigger to `main` and merge once) or
`base-branch` resolved to an empty string — neither of those two last causes affects the default
`fail-on: policy`, which does not need a baseline to gate.

### Two EvalShift comments on one PR

Either two action invocations are commenting, or the original comment fell off the first page of
the comments API on a long thread.

### The job hangs with no output

It doesn't — output is buffered per command and printed when each finishes. A slow suite is
silent while it runs.

### `pip install evalshift==1.2.1` fails

`python-version` is below the CLI's minimum. EvalShift 1.2.1 needs Python 3.11+.

### Costs are higher than expected

The runner cache is cold every run. Narrow the trigger with `on.pull_request.paths`, shrink the
CI suite, or swap LLM-judge evaluators for structural ones in a CI-specific config.

## Versioning and stability

Pin to `@v0` to track the latest v0.x, or to an exact tag such as `@v0.6.2` for a fully
reproducible workflow. The `evalshift-version` input pins the CLI separately — pin both if you
want a workflow that behaves identically six months from now.

This repo's CI includes a `cli-contract` job that installs the exact pinned CLI version and
runs `scripts/cli_contract.sh` to assert the command-line surface the action depends on still
exists. It costs nothing (no API keys, no model credits) and it's the early-warning system for
CLI drift. A separate manual `dogfood` workflow exercises the whole path — install, run, hosted
push, baseline lookup, outputs — against a four-example fixture project; it's manual because it
spends real credits.

The `evalshift-version` default in `action.yml` is the single source of truth for the pinned
CLI. Every other mention (README, this document, `llms-full.txt`) is asserted equal by
`tests/test_pin_consistency.py`, and `scripts/bump_cli_pin.py <new-version>` rewrites all of
them plus the action's patch version in `pyproject.toml`. The pin is kept current by
`.github/workflows/bump-cli-pin.yml`: it runs daily (polling PyPI for the latest release), on
`workflow_dispatch` with an optional `version` input, or on `repository_dispatch` of type
`evalshift-cli-release`. Before opening anything it checks the target's `requires-python`
against the `python-version` default, installs the target CLI and runs the contract script, then
runs the bump script and the test suite; only then does it open a PR on branch
`bump/evalshift-<version>` titled `chore(pin): evalshift <old> → <new>`. The optional
`BUMP_PR_TOKEN` secret (a fine-grained PAT with `contents` and `pull-requests` write) lets the
normal CI run on that PR — a PR opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger `ci.yml`; without the
secret the PR still opens, pre-validated, provided the repository allows GitHub Actions to
create pull requests.

Merging a PR that bumps `version` in `pyproject.toml` *is* the release — there are no manual
tags. On every push to `main`, `.github/workflows/release.yml` creates `v<version>` on the merge
commit if it does not exist yet, force-moves the floating `v0` tag to the same commit (only `v0`
is ever moved), and publishes a GitHub Release with generated notes since the previous `v0.*`
tag; ordinary merges stop green. So a merged bump PR reaches every `@v0` consumer immediately.
The workflow refuses a major other than `0` — a 1.x release needs a `v1` tag and a docs change.

The action is MIT licensed. The EvalShift CLI it installs is licensed separately
(Apache-2.0).

## FAQ

**Does this replace the CLI?**
No. It runs the CLI. Everything you can inspect locally — `report.html`, `analysis.json`, the
raw model outputs — is still produced, in the runner's workspace under `.evalshift/runs/`.

**Can I use it without hosted EvalShift?**
Not currently. The baseline lookup and the diff are server-side; without a hosted token there's
nothing to compare against. If you want local-only CI gating, use `evalshift compare` directly plus
a migration policy in your config, and skip this action.

**Does it upload my model outputs?**
It pushes the run bundle — manifest, examples, outputs, scores, analysis, and the HTML report —
to hosted EvalShift. It never uploads provider API keys. If your suite contains sensitive
production data, that's the thing to weigh.

**Why did the check pass when the report clearly shows a regression?**
Three common reasons. The default `fail-on: policy` gates on your migration policy, and a
regression that stays inside its budgets is a pass by design; `fail-on: never` is set; or there
was no compatible baseline so nothing was compared. The comment states which.

**Can I run it on a schedule instead of on PRs?**
Yes — it works on any trigger. On non-PR events you get the commit status and the outputs but no
comment. A nightly run against `main` is a reasonable way to catch provider-side model drift.

**Does it work on self-hosted runners?**
Yes, provided the runner can install Python and reach PyPI, your model provider, and the hosted
API.

**How long does a run take?**
Install is 20–60 seconds. After that it's however long your suite takes at your configured
concurrency, times two models. A 40-example suite is typically a few minutes.
